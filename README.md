# TicTacTwo - Multi-Platform Collection

A collection of **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implementations across different platforms: **Console App**, **ASP.NET Core Web App**. This repo contains 2 versions of the TicTacTwo game, each with the same core gameplay, but built using different technologies.
This includes 2 out of 7 TicTacTwo games developed for Uni 2024-2025.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` to explain the specific implementation details of that version.

### üöÄ Game Overview

TicTacTwo is a creative twist on the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game. The game is played on a larger grid (by default 5√ó5), with a smaller section (by default 3√ó3) active at any time. As the game progresses, players can move their markers or even shift the active section of the grid. You can play **locally** with a friend, **online** with password protection, against the **AI**, or watch **bots vs bots** mode.
