# TicTacTwo Console Application

A terminal-based implementation of the TicTacTwo game with interactive navigation and colorful interface.
1 out of 7 TicTacTwos made in Uni for 2024-2025. (1 out of 2 in C#)

## üéÆ Game Description

TicTacTwo is an advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe with a unique twist: the game is played on a larger board (default 5√ó5), but only a smaller section (default 3√ó3) is active at any time. After a configurable number of total moves, players unlock special abilities to either place new markers, move existing ones, or shift the active grid. Each player has a maximum of 6 markers by default.
